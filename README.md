# Thinkfulbnb

Working on this project, I practiced following a mobile-first approach to web development through the use of media queries and flexbox layouts. AI created a responsive website that can be viewed via desktop and mobile. I also wrote code in html and css

Thinkful-bnb is a mock vacation rental website that allows people to rent out their homes to people who are seeking short-term accommodations in that locale.
